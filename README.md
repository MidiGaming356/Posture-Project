<h1>Your Purpose/ Problem/ Issue/ Topic</h1> 
<p>Many of us struggle with maintaining good posture, a common issue for over 80% of Americans. And less than ½ of Americans feel concerned about poor posture according to a survey from “EurekAlert!” As the Better Health Channel reported, poor posture can lead to long-term problems such as back pain, body aches, "rounded shoulders," and more.</p> 
<h1>Design Goal/ Statement</h1>
<p>I will use Teachable Machine AI to improve one’s posture.<p> 
<h1>Criteria and Constraints</h1>  
     <h3>Criteria: </h3> 
	<p> - Teachable machine’s AI should be able to tell the difference between “good” and “bad” posture at an accuracy of at least 80% </p>
	<p> - It should not take over any physical space or area.</p>
	<p> - It must be easy to use/ understand</p>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>  
	<p> - The AI needs to be created without having to write extensive code - The device needs to be created using “Teachable Machine ™.” - The budget for the project is $99.00.
