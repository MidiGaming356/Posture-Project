<h2>Proposal/About my project</h2>
<h3>Your Purpose/ Problem/ Issue/ Topic</h3>
<p>  

Many of us struggle with maintaining good posture, a common issue for over 80% of Americans. However, many are not even aware of their poor posture as is evidenced in the following statistics, “ less than ½ of Americans feel concerned about poor posture according to a survey from EurekAlert!” As the Better Health Channel reported, poor posture can lead to long-term problems such as back pain, body aches, "rounded shoulders," and more.  

Design Goal/ Statement  

I will use Teachable Machine AI to improve one’s posture.  

3. Criteria and Constraints  

     Criteria:   

Teachable machine’s AI should be able to tell the difference between “good” and “bad” posture at an accuracy of at least 80%  

It should not take over any physical space or area. 

It must be easy to use/ understand 

Constraints:   

The AI needs to be created without having to write extensive code - The device needs to be created using “Teachable Machine ™.” - The budget for the project is $99.00.  </p>
